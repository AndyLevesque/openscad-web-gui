# WebOpenSCAD

This project uses [`openscad-wasm`](https://github.com/openscad/openscad-wasm) under the hood to
build an editor for OpenSCAD that is capable of loading `.scad` files from other servers.

It is capable of rendering and exporting your creations. There is also a naive implementation of a
visual customizer.
